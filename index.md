## This website is a first attempt at creating an online resource of tunes we all ought to play together. You'll find a list of tunes, and a growing collection of links to videos and/or recordings as well as tabs and sheet music. There are many such lists already out there, this is simply the list of tunes I already know and would love to play with you too.

I like fiddle tunes, especially old-time tunes and Irish tunes, so that's mostly what you'll find here. You should learn them! If there are some tunes you know that you'd like to see up here, let me know and I'll put them up.
