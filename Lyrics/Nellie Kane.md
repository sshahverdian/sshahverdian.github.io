**Nellie Kane**

When I was just a young man I went out on the western plain, 

In the state of North Dakota I met my Nellie Kane, 

I met my Nellie Kane.


She was living in a lonesome cabin with a son by another man,

Five years she'd waited for him, long as a woman can, 

As long as a woman can.


I don't know what changed my mind, 

Til then I was a rambling kind,

The kind of love I can't explain,

That I had for Nellie Kane


She took me on to work that day to help her till the land,

In the afternoon we planted seeds in the evening we held hands,

In the evening we held hands.

Her blue eyes told me everything a man could want to know, 

It was then I realized that I would never go,

I would never go.

I don't know what changed my mind,

Till then I was a rambling kind,

The kind of love I can't explain, 

That I had for Nellie Kane.
