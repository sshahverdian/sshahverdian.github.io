**Pretty Saro lyrics** (Tatiana Hargreaves)

I have left my pretty Saro, and I quit my mother too, 
I have started out to ramble, this country all through
And when I get tired, I will set down and weep
And I'll think of my little darlin' wherever I sleep

It is not this long journey I'm a dreading to go, 
Or the country I come from , or the debts that I owe, 
There's just one thing that grieves me and troubles my mind, 
It's leaving my little darlin' way back here behind

If I were a merchant, and I could write a fine hand, 
I would write her a letter that she'd understand, 
I would write by the river where the water's o'erflow, 
And I'd dream of my little Saro, wherever I go.

Oh Saro, pretty Saro, please tell me your mind, 
Do you think me unworthy, do you think me unkind, 
When our life here is over you surely will see,
I have treated you as kindly as you treated me
