hello hon how are you?
glad I caught you home
your wayfarin stranger
just done broke his travelin bone

i just called to tell you 
i'm not far away
go turn on the porch light
i'm a coming home to stay

Chorus x2
wait a little longer
just a little longer
wait a little longer
I'm a coming home real soon

go get my pajamas 
from the hamper bin
wash them up on gentle
and put fabric softener in

put them in the dryer
set on the tumble dry
before you hear the buzzer
i'll be wearin 'em by and by

had enough of highways
honky tonks and bars
when I get back home 
I'm gonna hold you in my arms

we got something special
good as lovin' gets
happy ever after
hasn't even started yet
